Create footnotes using a simple, easy-to-read syntax. Based on WP-Footnotes by Simon Elvery.

== Description ==

Civil Footnotes is a WordPress plugin for displaying footnotes on your blog. Civil Footnotes parses your posts for notes wrapped in ((double parenthesis)), which are then reformatted as footnotes.

There are many solutions for deploying footnotes on your WordPress blog, but Civil Footnotes stands above the rest. Most importantly, the syntax for creating notes is simple and very readable as plain text.

The majority of Civil Footnotes' formatting it taken from Daring Fireball, which first debuted this style of footnotes [almost eight years ago](http://daringfireball.net/2005/07/footnotes).

One key difference is the addition of `title` attributes to the footnote references in the text. One need only hover their cursor over the reference to read the note, eliminating two mouse clicks. For a full list of benefits and various other information, visit [the plugin page](https://defomicron.net/projects/civil_footnotes) on the author's website.

Civil Footnotes is based on [WP-Footnotes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-footnotes/), a WordPress plugin developed by [Simon Elvery](http://elvery.net).

You can install easiest through the Admin area in your WordPress install, otherwise:

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
